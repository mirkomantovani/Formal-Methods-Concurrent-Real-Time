-- The robot has a center position, and from that position it can be present only in
-- adjacent areas from the center. The Position predicate represent these adjacent
-- position, while the center predicate specify the current central position of the robot.
-- Another condition we need to supply is the fact that the robot cannot "teleport".
-- This condition is guaranteed by the fact that any new position that the robot assumes
-- must be adjacent to at least one position of the robot in the past.
