-- This class is a subclass of PositionSensor and specifies a new predicate for the
-- sensor that will be used for on the robot. The new predicate center will be defined
-- for the cart and arm of the robot, and it will specify which is its center.
-- For the cart it will be its actual center position, while for the arm it will be the 
-- point attached to the cart.
-- We will need to bind the Center of the arm with the Center of the Cart to maintain
-- the coherence in the model.
